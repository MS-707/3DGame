# Implementation Plan: Urban Tank Warfare

This step-by-step plan is designed for offline development with QWQ-Code 32B. Each step is self-contained with clear success criteria and testing guidance.

## Phase 1: Project Setup and Core Systems

### Step 1: Project Configuration
1. Create a new Unreal Engine 5 project with the following settings:
   - Template: Blank
   - Graphics: Default 3D
   - Starter Content: Yes
   - C++ Support: Yes
2. Set up basic project folders:
   - Content/Maps
   - Content/Vehicles/Tanks
   - Content/Environment
   - Content/UI
3. **Test**: Project opens successfully with no errors in log

### Step 2: Basic Tank Movement System
1. Create a new C++ class `ATankPawn` inheriting from `APawn`
2. Implement basic tank movement:
   - Forward/backward movement based on physics
   - Left/right rotation
   - Simple camera setup
3. Create a simple test map with a flat plane
4. **Test**: Player can control the tank on the flat plane; movement feels weighty and deliberate

### Step 3: Tank Input System
1. Create dedicated input mappings for tank control
2. Implement advanced tank controls:
   - Throttle control
   - Independent track movement for turns
   - Camera controls with zoom
3. **Test**: Tank controls respond naturally to player input; turning radius changes with speed

### Step 4: Basic Weapon System
1. Create a `UWeaponComponent` class for the tank
2. Implement primary cannon:
   - Basic firing mechanism
   - Simple projectile class
   - Recoil effect
3. Add visual and sound effects for firing
4. **Test**: Tank can fire projectiles in the direction of the turret

## Phase 2: Environment and Game Mechanics

### Step 5: City Environment Prototype
1. Design a basic city grid layout
2. Create modular building components:
   - Building foundations
   - Wall sections
   - Simple facades
3. Assemble a prototype city block
4. **Test**: Tank can navigate around buildings; no collision issues

### Step 6: Destructible Environment
1. Implement destructible components for buildings
2. Create damage system for environment objects
3. Add visual effects for destruction
4. **Test**: Firing at buildings causes appropriate damage and visual breakage

### Step 7: Game Mode Implementation
1. Create a basic `ATankGameMode` class
2. Implement simple deathmatch rules
3. Add respawn logic and match timing
4. **Test**: Match starts and ends correctly; player respawns after destruction

### Step 8: Tank Health and Damage System
1. Implement component-based damage system for tanks
2. Create visual damage states for tanks
3. Add effects for critical damage and destruction
4. **Test**: Tanks take appropriate damage when hit; destruction looks convincing

## Phase 3: AI and Multiplayer Framework

### Step 9: AI Tank Implementation
1. Create `ATankAIController` class
2. Implement basic pathfinding and obstacle avoidance
3. Add simple target acquisition and firing logic
4. **Test**: AI tanks can navigate the environment and engage targets

### Step 10: Local Multiplayer Setup
1. Configure input for multiple local players
2. Implement split-screen functionality
3. Create player identification UI elements
4. **Test**: Two players can play simultaneously in split-screen

### Step 11: Multiplayer Framework (Optional with QWQ-32B)
1. Set up basic networked gameplay components
2. Implement client-server communication for essential functions
3. Create lobby system for match creation
4. **Test**: Simple networked match can be created and joined

## Phase 4: Polish and Refinement

### Step 12: Tank Customization System
1. Create component-based tank customization
2. Implement visual customization options
3. Add performance modifications affecting gameplay
4. **Test**: Players can customize tanks with visible and gameplay effects

### Step 13: UI Implementation
1. Design and implement main menu
2. Create HUD with health, ammo, and radar
3. Add scoreboard and match information displays
4. **Test**: UI is functional and provides necessary information

### Step 14: Audio System
1. Implement engine sound system that responds to throttle
2. Add weapon and impact sound effects
3. Create ambient city sounds
4. **Test**: Audio enhances gameplay and provides appropriate feedback

### Step 15: Performance Optimization
1. Implement LOD system for distant objects
2. Add occlusion culling for city environments
3. Optimize physics calculations for multiple tanks
4. **Test**: Game maintains stable framerate even with multiple tanks and destruction

## Note on QWQ-Code 32B Capabilities

QWQ-Code 32B should be capable of handling most of these tasks with some limitations:

- **Strengths**: Core gameplay mechanics, basic AI implementation, local multiplayer setup
- **Challenges**: Complex networking code, advanced physics simulations, shader programming
- **Approach**: Break down complex tasks into smaller steps and provide detailed context

For best results:
1. Provide clear, focused prompts for each subtask
2. Include relevant code snippets and context from previous steps
3. Test incrementally and correct errors before moving forward
